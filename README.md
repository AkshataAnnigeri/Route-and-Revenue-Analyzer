# Route-and-Revenue-Analyzer - UK Railway
### Overview
I took on the role of a BI Developer for National Rail, a company that provides business services to passenger train operators in England, Scotland, and Wales. The aim of this project was to create an exploratory dashboard to assist in identifying the most popular routes, determining peak travel times, analyzing revenue from different ticket types and classes, and diagnosing on-time performance and contributing factors.

### Objectives
The main objectives of this project were to:

1)Identify the most popular routes.
2)Determine peak travel times.
3)Analyze revenue from different ticket types and classes.
4)Diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors.

### Tools and Technologies Used
1)Excel: Utilized for data mining, cleaning, and preprocessing to gain insights.
2)Power BI: Used to create insightful and interactive dashboards to enhance decision-making speed and reduce data retrieval time.
3)DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Employed in Power BI for advanced metric calculations.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analyzed
1)Route Popularity: Analyzed to identify the most frequently used routes.
2)Peak Travel Times: Determined to understand the busiest travel periods.
3)Revenue by Ticket Type/Class: Examined to assess financial performance across different categories.
4)On-time Performance Factors: Diagnosed to understand punctuality issues and their contributing factors

### Project Workflow
1)Data Mining and Cleaning: Collected and cleaned the dataset using Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2)Data Preprocessing: Prepared the data for analysis, including handling missing values and formatting.
3)Dashboard Creation in Power BI:
4)Designed interactive dashboards to visualize the data effectively.
5)Created multiple visualizations to provide insights into the KPIs.
6)Advanced Metric Calculations with DAX: Implemented advanced calculations to derive meaningful insights from the data.

### Results
The exploratory dashboard provided valuable insights into:
The most popular routes and their usage patterns.
Peak travel times, enabling better resource allocation.
Revenue trends across different ticket types and classes, helping to identify lucrative segments.
On-time performance issues and their contributing factors, facilitating improvements in punctuality.

### Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the use of Excel and Power BI to perform comprehensive data analysis and visualization. The interactive dashboards created in Power BI have significantly enhanced decision-making capabilities for National Rail, providing them with crucial insights to optimize their operations and improve service quality.
